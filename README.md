# resources

## a open source code with the primary goal of track the general core resources of a modern life, time and money(and the relantionship between boths).

## Goals

- make easy dynamic and automated the track of the main core resources of a modern human life.
- expose some relevant informations like money/hour of a period of time, hours of work on a transaction,expended in daily locomotions
- make a simple web applications to serve as interface to a api with a local and/or cloud database.
- expose a simple contract of api to be used as friendly as possible for others developers.
- create dynamic integrations with programatic periodic and triggered actions to interact with useful services a not short list of this services as : 

  - GCalendar
  - GFit
  - GTask
  - GMail
  - GKeep
  - Git Hub
  - WakaTime
  - GAssistant
  - Other similar and useful services... 

### fundamentals

the resource project is based in two main type of timelines one type to track events on time with the minimal modular quantity of **one minute** and minimal cycle of **one day** and other timeline to track amount of abstract currency in transactions with a minimal modular quantity of **1E-10{abstract_currency}** and a minimal cycle of **one transaction**.

## Architecture and Researches

For now the first thoughts is in **back-end** work with **python** make a api based on **flask**, use a databse based on no-sql or maybe graph; In **front-end** a Progressive Web Application writed with **react** and **redux**.
